## Major Subjects in the First Semester of BCA

In the first semester of BCA, we focus on two major subjects:

1. **C Programming**
2. **Digital Electronics**

## C Programming

C programming is fundamental to building a strong foundation in programming. It is a general-purpose, procedural language that supports structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. A solid understanding of C will be beneficial throughout your programming career.

### ðŸ“š Books
- [C Programming Language - 2nd Edition (OCR).pdf](https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/C%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition%20(OCR).pdf)

  This book is a comprehensive guide to getting started with C programming.


### ðŸŽ¥ Video Tutorials

#### 1. English
- [Learn C Programming and OOP with Dr. Chuck \[feat. classic book by Kernighan and Ritchie\] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaPN51Mm5qQ&t=5509s)

  This 18hr long video  by Dr. Chuck covers the entire content of the  book mentioned above , making it a great resource for visual learners.

#### 2. Hindi
- [C Language Tutorial for Beginners (with Notes & Practice Questions) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqbmMNs2Bo)

  This is a long video covering the fundamentals of C taught by shraddha didi.

### ðŸ“„ Notes
- [C Programming Language Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/?ref=lbp)

  For those who prefer learning by reading articles like me , this comprehensive tutorial from GeeksforGeeks is a fantastic resource. Infact I would credit my high marks in C to this website

### PYQ
- [Makaut PYQ](https://makaut.org/pages/bca#semester1)

Solving atleast the last 5 years pyq would suffice

## Digital Electronics

In Digital Electronics, you'll learn about different types of circuits, such as full adders, multiplexers, flip-flops, and more. This subject is interesting, though I found it less important for my career than C programming.

### ðŸ“š Books

The textbook provided by the college should be sufficient, but I recommend supplementing your study with specific topics from this book:


[ Digital Electronics Principles, Devices and Application](https://www.shahucollegelatur.org.in/Department/Studymaterial/sci/it/BCA/FY/digielec.pdf)

Just do the topics given in the syllabus and you will be good to go.

### ðŸŽ¥ Video Tutorials

The video tutorials I followed were from Neso Academy. They cover everything in a structured manner with the right amount of depth.
- [Digital Electronics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0mx8S05v60&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjMH3mWf6kwqiTbT798eAOm)

Unfortunately, I don't have any Hindi tutorials for this subject at the moment, but I'll update this list with more resources in the future.

### ðŸ“„ Notes

If Antara Ma'am is taking your classes, you're in luck, as she provides excellent handwritten notes herself.
Another useful resource for notes would be the video slides of the Neso Academy videos.

### PYQ
- [Makaut PYQ](https://makaut.org/pages/bca#semester1)
