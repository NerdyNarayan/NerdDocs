# Introduction

<Warning />

> Data structures by themselves arenâ€™t all that useful, but theyâ€™re indispensable when used in specific applications, like finding the shortest path between points in a map, or finding a name in a phone book with say, a billion elements (no, binary search just doesnâ€™t cut it sometimes!). By Algosaurus

## Choose a programming language

I would suggest C or C++ for learning data structures and algorithms. Building a strong foundation is important so choose a language that is close to the hardware. C and C++(not sure why some people hate c++ ) are the best choices for this.
After you get a good grasp of data structures and algorithms, you can start preparing in more high-level languages like Python, Java, etc. As these languages are easier to implement in interviews.

- C : [Learn C](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
- C++ : [Learn C++](https://learncpp.com/)

For other langauges more resources can be found [here](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/main/programming-language-resources.md)
I would suggest getting decent in the lanagauge you choose before starting with data structures and algorithms.

You are free to make your own choices here.

## Choose how to learn

1. Video tutorials
   - [Abdul Bari's Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/)
   - [mycodeschool goldmine](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P)
2. Problem Solving driven approach
   - [Striver SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)
   - [Needcode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
   - ...

Reasons

1. Abdul Bari covers all the fundamental data structures and algorithms in such a way that you will never forget them. He explains the concepts in a very simple way . I would highly recommend his course.
2. **Striver's SDE** sheet is all you need to learn data structures and algorithms. I would go further and say if already have know c or c++ just start here you won't regret it
3. **Neetcode** is similar to Striver's SDE sheet but it has less problems than Striver's SDE sheet so you can choose between the two depending on the time you can allot . It is a great resource to learn data structures and algorithms.
